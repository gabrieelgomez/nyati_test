## Instructions:
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Foo".
For multiples of 5 print "Bar". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FooBar".
But here's the catch: you can use only one if. No multiple branches, ternary operators or else.

## Requirements:
* 1 if
* You can't use else, else if or ternary
* Unit tests
* Feel free to apply your S.O.L.I.D knowledge (highly appreciated)
* You can write the challenge in any language you want.

## Submission:
Create a repository on GitLab, GitHub or any other similar service and just send us the link.
